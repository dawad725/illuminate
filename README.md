# illuminate

Illuminate is an application I built that helps consumers understand the approximate savings potential they will see by upgrading their current lighting in their home to energy efficient LED lighting. It displays the cost to upgrade your lighting and calculates the ROI through the savings the new lights save. You also have the option to pick a brand of lights you want to upgrade your home with and print a shopping list to go to home depot to pick up.
